# Traffic-Lights-Control

Traffic Lights Control is a Windows Form Application written in C# and simulates the way traffic lights work in real conditions with the help of timers. 

There are 2 traffic light control type levels offered:

*Intermediate Level

It allows you to control only 1 independent traffic light by either changing it manually or setting your preferred intervals for each traffic light's color.

*Advanced Level

This time you have 2 different traffic lights that are located at a junction and you can do the same as with the previous level but with the main difference that since the 2 lights
are at a junction they are programmed in a way that they shouldn't cause a collision.
